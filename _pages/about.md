20+ years of industry experience building up capability and capacity focusing on delivering results. True innovator with strong industry connections. A passionate linchpin who can quickly connect dots and identify new opportunities.

I am exceptional at taking on brand new challenges with a fresh pair of eyes. I have worked for a wide range of companies including [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/home), [Broadcom](https://www.broadcom.com/), [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en.html), [Semtech/Gennum](https://www.semtech.com/products/signal-integrity), [HP/Agilent/Keysight](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/home.html) in the fields of WiFi, Wireless, RF Frond End, optical, high speed SerDes, MultiCore CPU/GPU for low power design and mixed signal. This is not a one-year experience repeated 20+ times. My diverse architect role experiences helped me gain valuable insights to connect dots from seemingly unrelated things. Here is a condensed list that will be of value for the whole industry.

- My [M-shaped knowledge](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/which-letter-shaped-employee-you-gaurav-sharma/) with a continuous learning and growth mindset is perfect as the architect role.
- My architect role experience covers the wide range from silicon backend operation all the way to system level frontend concept design phase. 
- My data analysis skills and experience brings huge value in data-driven decision making.
- I think outside of the box.

I graduated from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) and post studied at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/)
