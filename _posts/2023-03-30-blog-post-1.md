## LTE/5G/WiFi/BT convergency RF architect 

### Only few sharing designs among channels in today's designs. Evert RF signal has its dedicated HW from lower lawyer Phy (PMD): Baseband, RFA, PA/LNA, filters, switches, antenna sharing etc. The DC power consumption efficiency will become low when total numbers of imdenpent channel is increaing. And complex of PCB level turning is much more difficult alone with total numbers of RF chain increasing.

###  Tomorrow Tx Architect: power consumption will save ~40% from today's design and PCB level complex and BOM cost improved dramaticlly. The improvement is mainly due removed the post PA complex RF switch/Filter/n-plixer insertion loss (2.5~3dB)

###  Future ~10 years Universal Tx Architect: Baseband sum (simulation can be done today on Matlab or SystemVue) all the post CFR data stream and then whole DPD function is applying to the combined Baseband signal. This design requires 10~20G/s sample rate with 18~19bits AtoD. AtoD power consumption @ 10G/s need to drop to the equivlent level as today's 1G/s design level.
